# GeekcampSG Conference Playbook

This conference planning playbook is work-in-progress, aiming to guide the running of future Geekcamp conferences.

Highly inspired by @winston's [Conference Planning Playbook](https://github.com/winston/Conference_Planning_Playbook)

### Marketing
The objective of the marketing team is to create awareness of GeekcampSG

#### Expectations
Marketing team members need to manage and utilise social media and mailing lists to reach out to target segments. It is ok to be unfamiliar with the tools, but it is highly recommended that interested candidates should at least have some experience with using social media.

#### People
Assuming all templates are in place:
- Pre-conference: Min 1 pax. Ideally at least 2 pax
- Conference: Min 2 pax. Ideally at least 3 pax

Note: during D day. There is a lot of work to be done. The lesser people there are for marketing, the less capacity there is to execute the full marketing plan

#### Tasks

##### Access
- Give trusted members of the team access to the social media accounts

##### Notifications
- Setup email forwarding for new marketing team members
- Setup tweetdeck to monitor hashtags and mentions

##### Queries
- Ensure that queries sent via email and on social media are answered promptly

##### Prepare messaging templates for event phases
- Recruitment
- Team meeting pictures
- Sponsorship deck
- CFP + conference date
- CFP closing soon / CFP extension
- Confirmed schedule
- Collect speaker's social media handles
- Individual talk/speaker promotion
- Registration
- Sponsor shoutouts
- Reminder of event at D-1
- D-day postings for each talk: start and end
